The film series started with a trilogy set in medias res that was later expanded to a trilogy of trilogies, known as the \"Skywalker Saga\".\nThe 1977 self-titled film, later subtitled Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope, was followed by the sequels The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983), subtitled onscreen as Episode V and Episode VI; these films form the original trilogy. Sixteen years later, the prequel trilogy was released, consisting of The Phantom Menace (1999), Attack of the Clones (2002), and Revenge of the Sith (2005). After creator George Lucas sold Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, a sequel trilogy consisting of Episodes VII through IX was released, consisting of The Force Awakens (2015), The Last Jedi (2017), and The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe first three spin-off films produced were the made-for-television Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), The Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985). Following Disney's 2012 acquisition of the franchise, these earlier films were dropped from the official canon, but the theatrical animated film Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008) and its television series continuation retain their canonical status. Two standalone films were produced and released between the sequel trilogy films: Rogue One (2016) and Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018), both set between the original and prequel trilogies. A yearslong hiatus began in late 2019, during which time numerous films were announced and often shelved. Five officially announced projects were reputedly being developed as of early 2024.\nThe combined box office revenue of the films amounts to over ten billion dollars, and it is currently the second-highest-grossing film franchise. The major live-action releases (including all the films within the Skywalker Saga) were nominated for Academy Awards. The original film was nominated for most of the major categories, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Alec Guinness (who played Obi-Wan Kenobi), while all theatrical live-action films have been nominated for particular categories. Several official Star Wars television series have also been released, all now on Disney+.\n\n\n== Skywalker Saga ==\nThe main Star Wars film series is a trilogy of subtrilogies; as it neared completion, Lucasfilm began to refer to it as the \"Skywalker Saga\". It was released beginning with the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V and VI, 1977\u20131983), followed by the prequel trilogy (Episodes I, II and III, 1999\u20132005) and the sequel trilogy (Episodes VII, VIII and IX, 2015\u20132019). The first film released, Star Wars (1977), is the fourth film chronologically and was later subtitled Episode IV \u2013 A New Hope. The saga begins chronologically with Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace (1999) and concludes with Episode IX \u2013 The Rise of Skywalker (2019).\nThe story follows each generation of the Force-sensitive Skywalker family and their struggle against Palpatine, an evil Sith Lord known as Darth Sidious. The prequel trilogy focuses on Anakin Skywalker's training as a Jedi and his fall to the dark side as Darth Vader. The original trilogy follows his children, Luke and Leia, as they join forces with Han Solo and the Rebel Alliance against Vader and Palpatine's Empire. The sequel trilogy features Kylo Ren (Ben Solo)\u2014Leia and Han's son and Luke's former Jedi apprentice\u2014who fell to the dark side and seeks to rule the galaxy with Rey, Palpatine's granddaughter and Luke and Leia's last Jedi apprentice.\nEach episodic film begins with an opening crawl, accompanied by the main Star Wars theme by John Williams, who composed each film's score. Following their initial theatrical releases, franchise creator George Lucas made multiple rounds of retroactive changes to the films of the original trilogy (and to a lesser extent, the prequels).", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3919, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "573614b5-d9b7-46ff-ac8e-6d73991d7978": {"__data__": {"id_": "573614b5-d9b7-46ff-ac8e-6d73991d7978", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3a6841cc-0a3b-4881-bd40-5990a87da5e0", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "37414e8b4941faf5b6a065125e25b5c2897c05a771412a0bd3558c6de5ba15c6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5a255438-784b-48c4-b540-586a7955959c", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "7ec43a3d990960bbff64539b52f8a178e5a8a947d64c2934a88b6af840d60630", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "49712170-4b89-40fa-ace3-beff994bb1e7", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "640adb80acdb425c800a54099205a231fcaf32b018e10a83e573f940db052276", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "text": "== Standalone films ==\nAs Lucas was outlining a trilogy of trilogies, he also imagined making additional movies unrelated to the Skywalker Saga. The first theatrical films set outside the main episodic series were the Ewok spin-off films Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure (1984) and Ewoks: The Battle for Endor (1985), the first of which was screened internationally after being produced for television.After the conclusion of his then-six-episode saga in 2005, Lucas returned to spin-offs in the form of television series.\nAn animated film, The Clone Wars (2008), was released as a pilot to a TV series of the same name. An anthology series set between the main episodes entered development in parallel to the production of the sequel trilogy, described by Disney chief financial officer (CFO) Jay Rasulo as origin stories. The first entry, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016), tells the story of the rebels who steal the Death Star plans directly before Episode IV. Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) focuses on Han's backstory, also featuring Chewbacca and Lando Calrissian.\n\n\n=== Animated film ===\n\n\n==== The Clone Wars (2008) ====\n\nPreceding the airing of the animated TV series in late 2008, the theatrical feature Star Wars: The Clone Wars was compiled from episodes \"almost [as] an afterthought.\" It reveals that Anakin trained an apprentice between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith; the series explains Padawan Ahsoka Tano's absence from the latter film.  The film and series exist in the same level of canon as the episodic and anthology films.\n\n\n=== Live-action films ===\nBefore selling Lucasfilm to Disney in 2012, and parallel to his development of a sequel trilogy, George Lucas and original trilogy co-screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan started development on a standalone film about a young Han Solo. In February 2013, Disney CEO Bob Iger made public the development of a Kasdan film and Entertainment Weekly reported that it would focus on Han Solo. Disney CFO Jay Rasulo has described the standalone films as origin stories. Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy confirmed that there was \"no attempt being made to carry characters (from the standalone films) in and out of the saga episodes.\" The standalone films are subtitled \"A Star Wars Story\".\n\n\n==== Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) ====\n\nRogue One is set directly before Episode IV: A New Hope and focuses on the eponymous group of rebels who obtain the plans to the Death Star. Its laser was developed by scientist Galen Erso (played by Mads Mikkelsen) after the Empire forcibly abducted him, separating him from his daughter Jyn. Galen secretly sends a defecting Imperial pilot, Bodhi Rook, to deliver a message warning of the weapon's existence and revealing its weakness to his rebel friend Saw Gerrera. Under the false promise of her father's liberation, Jyn agrees to help Rebel Alliance intelligence officer Cassian Andor and his droid K-2SO retrieve the message from Saw, now the paranoid leader of an extremist cell of rebels.\nThe idea for the movie came from John Knoll, the chief creative officer of Industrial Light & Magic. In May 2014, Lucasfilm announced Gareth Edwards as the director of an anthology film, with Gary Whitta writing the first draft for a release on December 16, 2016. The film's title was revealed to be Rogue One, with Chris Weitz rewriting the script, and Felicity Jones in the starring role. Ben Mendelsohn and Diego Luna also play new characters, with James Earl Jones returning to voice Darth Vader. Edwards stated, \"It comes down to a group of individuals who don't have magical powers that have to somehow bring hope to the galaxy.\" The film was the first to feature characters introduced in animated Star Wars TV series, namely The Clone Wars' Saw Gerrera, portrayed by Forest Whitaker in the film. The movie received generally positive reviews, with its performances, action sequences, soundtrack, visual effects and darker tone being praised.

Han \"Solo\" joins the Imperial Academy; however, he is expelled for his reckless behavior. Han and his newfound Wookiee friend Chewbacca resort to a criminal life, mentored by veteran smuggler Tobias Beckett. After angering gangster Dryden Vos, for whom Qi'ra now works, Han and his company's lives depend on pulling a heist for him. Without a ship to travel, they hire Lando Calrissian, the captain and owner of the Millennium Falcon. A twist ending acknowledges Maul's survival of The Phantom Menace, as previously explored by animated series.Before selling Lucasfilm to Disney, George Lucas had hired Star Wars original trilogy veteran Lawrence Kasdan to write a film about a young Han Solo. The film stars Alden Ehrenreich as a young Han Solo, Joonas Suotamo as Chewbacca (after serving as a double for the character in The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi), Donald Glover as Lando Calrissian, Emilia Clarke as Qi'ra, and Woody Harrelson as Beckett. Lucasfilm originally hired Phil Lord and Christopher Miller to direct, but they were fired during principal photography, and replaced by Ron Howard.\n\n\n==== Future ====\nIn mid-2018, Lucasfilm confirmed that multiple anthology films were in development, with their release following a hiatus after 2019's The Rise of Skywalker. Following multiple delays, dates in May 2026, December 2026 and December 2027 were reserved for Star Wars films. In May 2023, Kennedy said future Star Wars films would come out \"when they're ready\", citing the 3\u20134 year interim of more recent James Bond films.In May 2020, Taika Waititi was officially announced to direct a live-action Star Wars film. Three further live-action films were officially announced at April 2023's Star Wars Celebration, to be helmed by Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, Dave Filoni, and James Mangold. Kennedy said upcoming films would include the trademark opening crawl. In January 2024, a Mandalorian film from Jon Favreau was announced.Additionally, Kennedy stated in May 2022 that \"There's a couple of [filmmakers] that we've been in conversation with ... that I'm hoping will\" oversee future films in the way that Favreau and Filoni have done for Star Wars television series.\n\n\n===== The Mandalorian & Grogu (2026) =====\nIn 2019, then Walt Disney Studios CCO Alan Horn stated that if The Mandalorian was successful, a feature film spin-off would be considered. In January 2024, it was announced that series creator Jon Favreau would write and direct a film based on the series (separate from Filoni's upcoming film), titled The Mandalorian & Grogu. Filming was expected to begin later in 2024 as the first Star Wars film to enter production since The Rise of Skywalker. In February 2024, Disney CEO Bob Iger announced that the film is aiming for a 2026 release, although specifics were not given at the time.\n\n\n===== Untitled Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy film (TBA) =====\nIn October 2022, The Hollywood Reporter reported that after a two-week writers' room in July (which included Patrick Somerville, Rayna McClendon, Andy Greenwald, and maybe Dave Filoni), Damon Lindelof and Justin Britt-Gibson were co-writing a Star Wars film, with Ms. Marvel director Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy attached as director. THR reported that according to its sources, \"the project is intended as a stand-alone but in success could lead to more movies\", taking place after the sequel trilogy and possibly featuring some of its characters. In March 2023, it was reported that Lindelof and Britt-Gibson had left the project in mid-February and that Steven Knight was hired to replace them as screenwriter. Filming was reportedly set to begin in February 2024. At April 2023's Star Wars Celebration, Kennedy officially announced a Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy-directed movie, with Daisy Ridley returning as Rey as she constructs a new Jedi Order 15 years after the events of The Rise of Skywalker.

At Star Wars Celebration in 2023, it was announced that Dave Filoni would make his live-action feature directorial debut with a film set in the New Republic era, connecting storylines that began with The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and Skeleton Crew.\n\n\n===== Untitled James Mangold film (TBA) =====\nIn April 2023, during Star Wars Celebration Europe IV, Lucasfilm announced that James Mangold would write and direct a Star Wars film whose story \"will go back to the dawn of the Jedi\" and explore the origins of The Force, set around 25,000 years before the events of A New Hope. It is set to be the start of a new era set within Star Wars timeline, dubbed Dawn of the Jedi. The film has been described as a \"Cecil B. DeMille biblical epic.\", with Mangold citing The Ten Commandments as a major inspiration for the film. Mangold was offered the project during production of Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny. Mangold confirmed shortly afterwards that he had begun developing the film alongside his screenplay for the DC Universe Swamp Thing film, and was uncertain which project would move forward first following his Bob Dylan biopic.In September 2023, David S.

In June 2022, Waititi agreed with Kennedy's view that the films should move into new territory in favor of origin stories, and stated he would continue writing the project while filming other projects. The movie was reportedly expected to be shot in Los Angeles. By March 2023, Waititi was also likely to appear in the film. The next month, Kennedy stated that Waititi was now writing the film alone. In early May, Deadline Hollywood reported that Waititi may begin filming the project in 2024. In September 2023, amidst rumors of the film's cancellation, it was revealed that it was still in development and that Waititi would resume writing the script after the conclusion of the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike.\n\n\n===== Lando (TBA) =====\nIn 2018, while promoting Solo, Kathleen Kennedy expressed interest in making a spin-off film focusing on Lando Calrissian.

According to the official Star Wars website, the film would \"introduce a new generation of starfighter pilots as they earn their wings and risk their lives in a boundary-pushing, high-speed thrill-ride, and move the saga into the future era of the galaxy.\" According to Jenkins, the film would be an original story \"with great influence from the games and the books\". A script was being worked on as of December 2020, at which time, Wonder Woman 3's story was still being worked on. Matthew Robinson was hired to write Rogue Squadron in May 2021; late the next month, Jenkins revealed that the script was almost finished. On November 8, the film's production was delayed from 2022 due to Jenkins' busy schedule. A month later, Jenkins had left her planned Cleopatra film as director in order to focus on Rogue Squadron and Wonder Woman 3. Disney announced in April 2022 that the film was still set to be released in December 2023. Kathleen Kennedy stated in May that the film has been \"pushed off to the side for the moment\", with the script still being worked on and Waititi's film expected to be released first. On September 15, 2022, the film was confirmed to be taken off from Disney's release schedule, although in December Jenkins said she was actively working on it amid the apparent cancellation of Wonder Woman 3. In April 2023, Kennedy said the project could still happen either as a film or a television series.\n\n\n== Other future films ==\nRian Johnson, the writer/director of The Last Jedi (2017), is confirmed to write and direct the first film of a new trilogy he was outlining as of early 2019 with Ram Bergman producing alongside Kennedy. It was said to differ from the Skywalker-focused films in favor of focusing on new characters and possibly a different era than the main film franchise. The project was considered to have been \"back-burnered\" by May 2022 due to Johnson's involvement with other projects, including the Knives Out franchise. Johnson indicated that he would make at least one more film in that series following Glass Onion before returning to Star Wars.In November 2022, Deadline Hollywood reported that Shawn Levy was in talks to direct a Star Wars film, following his work on Deadpool 3 (2024) and the fifth and final season of Stranger Things.\n\n\n== Produced for television ==\nThe first spin-off film (also the first sequel to be released) was a holiday TV special aired in 1978.
